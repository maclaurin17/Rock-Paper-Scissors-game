# Rock-Paper-Scissors-game

Project Rock Paper Scissors

This is my first JavaScript program built from sratch. The program is a game that will be played by the computer and a single player. I started with a function called computerPlay that randomly returns either ‘Rock’, ‘Paper’ or ‘Scissors’. I also created another function call playerPlay that prompts the play to choose among 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors'. I then went on to create a function called playRound that plays a single round of the game.

Finally, I created a function called game that plays a 5 round game and records a score in each round. For this, I made use of For loop to make the function play the 5 rounds of the game.
